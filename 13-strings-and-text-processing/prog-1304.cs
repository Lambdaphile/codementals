| Chapter 13. Strings and Text Processing
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Exercise 4:
|
|     Write a program that detects how many times a substring
|     is contained in the text. For example, letâ€™s look
|     for the substring "in" in the text:
|
|       * We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have
|         anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight.
|         So we are drinking all the day.
|         We will move out of it in 5 days.
|
| Solutions and Guidelines:
|
|     Reverse the casing of letters in text to small and search
|     the given substring in a loop. Remember to use IndexOf(...)
|     with a start index in order to avoid infinite loop.
