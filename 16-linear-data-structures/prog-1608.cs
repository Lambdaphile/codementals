| Exercise 8:
|
|     The majorant of an array of size N is a value that occurs
|     in it at least N/2 + 1 times.
|     Write a program that finds the majorant of given array
|     and prints it. If it does not exist, print
|     "The majorant does not exist!".
|
|       * e.g. {2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3} -> 3
|
| Solutions and Guidelines:
|
|     Use list. Sort the list and you are going to get the equal
|     numbers next to one another. Scan the array by counting
|     the number of occurrences of each number.
|     If up to a certain moment a number has occurred N / 2 + 1
|     times, this is the majorant and there is no need
|     to check further. If after position N / 2 + 1 there is
|     a new number (a majorant is not found until this moment),
|     there is no need to search further â€“ even in the case
|     when the list is filled with the current number
|     to the end, it will not occur N / 2 + 1 times.
