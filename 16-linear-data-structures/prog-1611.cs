| Chapter 16. Linear Data Structures
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Exercise 11:
|
|     Implement the data structure dynamic doubly linked list
|     (DoublyLinkedList<T>) â€“ list, the elements of which
|     have pointers both to the next and the previous elements.
|     Implement the operations for adding, removing and searching
|     for an element, as well as inserting an element at a given
|     index, retrieving an element by a given index  and a method,
|     which returns an array with the elements of the list.
|
| Solutions and Guidelines:
|
|     Implement DoubleLinkedListNode<T> class, which has fields
|     Previous, Next and Value. It will hold to hold a single
|     list node. Implement also DoubleLinkedList<T> class
|     to hold the whole list.
