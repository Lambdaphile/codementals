|
| Exercise 12:
|
|     Write a program that calculates the sum (with precision
|     of 0.001) of the following sequence:
|
|       * 1 + 1 / 2 - 1 / 3 + 1 / 4 - 1 / 5 + ...
|
| Solutions and Guidelines:
|
|     Accumulate the sum of the sequence in a variable inside
|     a while-loop (see the chapter "Loops"). At each step
|     compare the old sum with the new sum. If the difference
|     between the two sums Math.Abs(current_sum â€“ old_sum) is
|     less than the required precision (0.001), the calculation
|     should finish because the difference is constantly
|     decreasing and the precision is constantly increasing at
|     each step of the loop. The expected result is 1.307.
